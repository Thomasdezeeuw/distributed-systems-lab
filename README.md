# Distributed System Lab Exercise

This was done as a Lab exercise for Distributed Computing Systems at the VU
Amsterdam.

The source code can be found in the [expirements] branch, which is a fork of
[OpenDC].

To run the experiment checkout the [expirements] branch, and in the root of the
repo run `$ ./experiment/run.bash`. To run the script the following software is
required:

 - Bash, needed to run the script.
 - Kotlin compiler (including Java requirements), needed to compile OpenDC.
 - R (Rscript command), needed to create graphs.

After the script is run a number of directories are created:

 - analysis, here a number of graphs are stored used in the paper.
 - data_workload$n_setup$n, output data generated by OpenDC for "workload$n" and
   setup "setup$n", see "experiment/input" for the workloads and setups.
